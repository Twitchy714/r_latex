The degradation of plant polymers in litter decay determines quality and quantity of recalcitrant carbon input to soils. Nevertheless, the involved transformations remain unclear. The properties of lignin during decomposition were questioned recently, the one of hydrophobic compounds were not assesed at all until now. External factors like nutrient availability...
