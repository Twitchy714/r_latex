Bulk litter, extractable, and microbial biomass stoichiometry</A>
</H2>
To calculate litter mass loss, litter dry mass content was measurment in 5 g litter (fresh weight) after 48 h at 80 &#176;C. Dried litter was ball-milled for further chemical analysis. Litter C and N content were determined using an elemental analizer (Leco CN2000, Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MI, USA). Litter phosphorus content was measured  with ICP-AES (Vista-Pro, Varian, Darmstadt, Germany) after acid digestion Henschler1988.

<P>
To determine contents of soluble, C, N an P were extracted from 1.8g litter (fresh weight) with 50 ml 0.5M K<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>. Samples were shaken on a reciprocal shaker with the extractant for 30 minutes at 200 oscillations, filtered with ash-free filters and frozen at -20 &#176;C until analysis. For quantifying microbial biomass C, N and P pools, the same extraction was used after chloroform fumigation [lit: schinner 1996]. Microbial biomass was determined as the difference between fumigated and non-fumigated extractions. C and N concentration in extracts were determined with a TOC/TN analyzer (TOC-VCPH and TNM, Schimadzu), Phosphorous was determined by [...!!]
