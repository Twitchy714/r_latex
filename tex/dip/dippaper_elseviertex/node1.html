<P>
While for [two decades] the different compound's roles in litter deomposition were thought assigned [and fixed], recent studies reopen the discussion. Doubt is cast the differences in recalcitrancy attributed to compound classes, which were considered established knowledge a few years ago. Marschner2008

<P>
Plant litter biomass is dominated by macromolecular compounds. Together, lignin, carbohydrate and protein polymers make up xx% of litter dry mass, while leach-able substances (``DOC'') in litter account for only xx %. Macromolecular lignin is result of a radical polymerization reaction of enzyme-activated hydroypropylphenol monomers. During polymerization, other compounds, especially carbohydrates and protein, are incorporated into lignin structures Achyuthan2010. Conventional litter decomposition models [lit] follow the idea that macromolecules in litter form three independent carbon pools of increasing recalcitrance. These pools are attributed to (1) soluble compounds (most prominently starch), (2) cellulose and hemi-celluloses and (3) lignin. During decomposition, soluble compounds are most accessible for microbes and consumed first, followed by carbohydrates (i.e. cellulose). Lignin is not degraded until accumulated to a certain, critical level at which the degradation of other compounds is inhibited. This concept was first described by [<A
 HREF="node27.html#Berg1980">Berg and Staaf(1980)</A>], and stills forms the base of recent models and textbooks [lit!!]. 

<P>
One reason for the popularity of this model is that sizes of the three carbon pools can easily determined by proximate analysis. In these methods, litter cellulose, hemi-celluloses and lignin content are determined by sequential extractions with selective solvents. Especially for lignin determination, these methods (``Klason''-Lignin [lit] and ``ADF''-/``Van Soest''-lignin [lit])  were repeatedly criticize as unspecific. When analyzed with alternative methods, extracted lignin fractions contain many other than the proclaimed substances. (for NMR studies see lit., for pyrolysis studies see lit., for CuO studies lit.). However, while not helpful in determining the fate of lignin in litter decomposition, extractive lignin fractions - better labeled ``acid insoluble residues'' (AUR) - can be used as an indicator for the content of the most recalcitrant carbon compounds in litter Prescott2010. For lipids and plant waxes, neither their accumulation/depletion during decomposition nor the effect of their concentration on decomposition processes is known [!check!,!lit!]

<P>
Recent studies using more specific methods (CuO - oxidation, pyr-GC/MS, NMR) to determine litter lignin content cast doubt on it's role in litter decomposition. Mean residence times for lignin were calculated from both laboratory and outdoor incubation of litter/soil mixtures. Often, lignin residence times found were no longer than other carbon compounds or bulk SOM Thevenot2010a, Bol2009. For litter, lignin decomposition rates did not increase from early to late decomposition stages Klotzbucher2011. Based on these results, the authors propose a new model for lignin degradation: fastest lignin degradation in litter decay occurs during early litter decomposition; lignin decomposition during late decomposition is limited by (dissolved organic) carbon availability. 

<P>
[<A
 HREF="node27.html#Klotzbucher2011">Klotzb&#252;cher et&nbsp;al.(2011)Klotzb&#252;cher, Kaiser, Guggenberger,
  Gatzek and Kalbitz</A>] do not elaborate the effect of macro-nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorous) availability on lignin decomposition. Nitrogen fertilization experiments on litter and soils suggest that litter nitrogen content affects lignin degradation: N addition increases mass loss rates in low-lignin litter while slowing down decomposition in lignin-rich litter Knorr2005. High nitrogen levels were reported to inhibit lignolytic enzyme in forest soilsSinsabaugh2010. Cellulose addition lead to a higher mineralization of SOM in fertilized than in unfertilized soils Fontaine2011. However, results of artificial fertilization can not be compared to different ``natural'' nutrient gradients. To our knowledge, no other experiment has yet compared effects of intra-specific variance in litter nutrient contents on decomposition processes.

<P>
Litter nitrogen content is expected to be altered anthopogenically: Elevated N deposition and elevated soil N content both  [lit] and possibly by elevated atmospheric CO<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

<P>
While predictions of changes on mass loss rates under modified C:N ratios are abound, no studies on changes in accumulation/depletion under changing litter chemistry exist. 

<P>
Several recent studies apply analytical pyrolysis to characterize high molecular weigh carbon.  soil organic matter (SOM [<A
 HREF="node27.html#Vancampenhout2010">Vancampenhout et&nbsp;al.(2010)Vancampenhout, De Vos, Wouters, Van
  Calster, Swennen, Buurman and Deckers</A>]). Only a limited number of pyrolysis studies comparing different decomposition levels have been done. Most of them study the woody material Vinciguerra2007, other studies (lit!) mix plant material with soils and to monitor decomposition processes in this mixture. [<A
 HREF="node27.html#Fran2002">Franchini et&nbsp;al.(2002)Franchini, Gonzalez-Vila and
  Rodrigues</A>]. We found only one study 

<P>
In this study we analyze samples of climate-chamber incubated beech litter varying in N and P content with Pyrolysis-GC/MS (pyr-GC/MS). The experiment was designed to study microbial decomposition, exclude decomposing fauna and keep climatic conditions constant. Extensive data on litter chemistry and and decomposition process rates are available for this samples from previously publications Mooshammer2011, Wanek2011, Leitner2011 as unpublished data [provided by the MicDiF national research network]. 

<P>
We focus on changes in lignin and carbohydrate content, assuming that

<P>
(1) Lignified biomass and non-lignified carbohydrates are alternative carbon sources. While free carbohydrates are easier to degrade and the resulting sugar monomers yield more energy, lignin degradation improves to accessibility of nitrogen (``lignin mining'') [lit.]. Microorganisms excrete different enzymes to degrade those substances. Substrate preference is determined by litter chemistry,

<P>
(2) More lignin are decomposed when nitrogen availability is low, hight nitrogen availability inhibits lignin degradations.

<P>
(3) Lignin degradation is inhibited when little DOC is available and decomposition is energy limited as proposed by [<A
 HREF="node27.html#Klotzbucher2011">Klotzb&#252;cher et&nbsp;al.(2011)Klotzb&#252;cher, Kaiser, Guggenberger,
