Decomposition trends</A>

<P>
To balance for initial differences in litter composition, for each peak in each sample, we substrate the mean of the relative peak area of the respective peak in initial litter of the litter type. A PCA calculated with the results allows us to demonstrate shifts between pyrolysis products during litter decomposition (fig. <A HREF="node27.html#fig:pca.dif">9</A>). The first to principal components represent&nbsp;45% of the total variance. Initial litter samples cluster cluster in the bottom right corner of the graph with positiv loadings on PCA 1 and negative loadings on PCA2. Decomposed samples are shifted versus fresh litter along different axis: While decomposed SW samples are in the bottom left quadrant of the samples, shifted along PCA 1 toward more negative values and indiffered along PCA1, decomposed AK samples are shifted along PCA2 towards more positive values and do not shift along PCA1. KL and OS show intermediate decomposition trends. Their decomposed samples are placed in the top left corner, combining both decomposition trends.  
Pyrolysis products that are positioned in the bottom-right quadrant  are depleated in all litter types, while products in the top left quadrant are accumulated in all litter types. Substances in the bottom left quadrant are depleated in AK and accumulated in SW, substances in the top-right quadrant show the oposite trend. 
Most lignin markers have negative loadings on PCA1 and PCA2, indicating accumulation in SW and depleation in AK. 

<P>
Figure <A HREF="node27.html#fig:timeseries">7</A> shows shifts in pyrolysis products relative to incubation time and accumulated respiration. Lignin contents were rising and carbohydrate contents decreasing for all litter types except AK. The two litter types with the highest lignin content show a (non-significant) decrease between 6 an 15 month harvests. Non-lignin phenolic pyrolysis products increase for all litter types, with SW's phenols showing increasing less then other litter.

<P>
While KL, OS and SW all accumulate lignin at a similar rate relative to dry mass loss/accumulate respiration, AK show no sign of lignin accumulation during early litter decomposition. A lignin maximum was found after 6 month, with relative depletion of lignin (not significant) between 6 and 15 month harvests in two litter types and no further increase of lignin content in the other two sites. 

<P>
While the other three sites had a similar increases in lignin:(lignin+carbohydrate) ratio (relative to the respiration rate), no increase in lignin (absolute or relative to carbohydrates was observed). Fig. <A HREF="node27.html#fig:lci">5</A> (left)

<P>
Fig. <A HREF="node27.html#fig:car_lig_6month">1</A> shows lignin and carbohydrate differences after 6 month. Lignin accumulation is highest in SW and lowest in AK. The the other two sites are inbetween, but only AK and SW are significantly seperated. Carbohydrates are significantly less depleted in AK than in KL, OS and SW. 

<P>
To discriminate between lignin accumulation because of higher or lower litter turnover and different substrate preferences, we compared changes in pyrolysis products to accumulated respiration. LCI index is rising in all litter types except AK, where it fell insignificantly.
Fig. <A HREF="node27.html#fig:lci">5</A> (right)

<P>
The lipophilic compounds found show different trends: Alkanes and alkenes show a drastic increase (+80%) during the first three month. This increase can not be explained by passive accumulation. Unlike alkene, alkanes are decomposed between month 6-15. The unknown compound at RT 20.00 and fatty acids are depleted during litter decomposition, i.e. decomposed faster than average litter biomass. (Fig nn). The last two lipophilic compound classes are decomposed faster in N-poor litter. Especially fatty acids were found in isolated AUR lignin fractions.
