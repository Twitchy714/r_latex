Potential enzyme activities</A>
</H3>

<P>
Absulute potential enzyme activities were generally correlated to litter N, respiration and other other decomposition processes. For all enzymes and at all time points, SW showed the highes and AK the lowest activity. After two weeks, only minimal activities could be detected. Cellulases activity is highest after 3 month and decreases between 3 and 6 month. Peroxidase activities were highly correlated to each other. They reach their maximum activity after 6 month. After between 6 and 15 month, cellulase activity strongly increased. The activity of oxidative enzymes was below the detection limit (approximately..) after 15 month (see Fig <A HREF="node27.html#fig:enz">3</A>).

<P>
The ratio between the potential activities of cellulases and oxidative enzymes show the lowest ratio for AK at all timepoints. This means, microbial communities in AK litter invest more energe and nitrogen into degrading lignin and less into degrading carbohydrates than other litter types.
