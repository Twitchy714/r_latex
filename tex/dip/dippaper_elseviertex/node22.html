Nutrient controls on carbon chemistry</A>

<P>
We found profound differences in patterns of accumulation and depletion of lignin and carbohydrates. During the first 6 month of decomposition, lignin is accumulated and carbohydrates are deplete in three litter types (KL, OS, SW). However, no lignin accumulation or carbohydrate depletion was accompanied litter degradation in the forth litter type (AK). To rule out that the missing shift in litter chemistry in AK was caused by low litter turnvoer, we compared changes in litter chemistry to respiration rates and mass loss (fig. <A HREF="node27.html#fig:lci">5</A> and <A HREF="node27.html#fig:timeseries">7</A>). Especially as OS hat only slightly higher accumulated respiration, but a similar rate of lignin accumulation like SW and KL. This indicates, that - in contrast to the other litter types - there is no microbial substrate preference of carbohydrates over lignin in AK Äºitter and lignin is decomposed during early litter decay in AK. In other sites, lignin is not decomposed or only at a rate relatively slower than carbohydrates. 

<P>
Potential enzyme activities support our findings: N-rich sites had the highest absolute activity for both cellulase and oxidative enzymes. This reflects higher turnover of organic carbon in N-rich litter observed in most decomposition processes [lit maria?]. Unlike [lit. sinsabaugh?] we did not find an inhibition in absolute terms of oxidative enzymes under high (natural/unfertilized) N content in (litter/substrate). The absolute amount of enzymes produced is limited by N availability and strongly correlated with other decomposition processes. Unlike the absolute amount of enzymes produced, the ratio between cellulose hydrolysing and oxidative enzymes is lower in AK than in other sites. Investments of the microbial community tend to be directed more into degrading lignin in AK than in other sites.

<P>
Unlike cellulose and protein, degradation of lignin does not yield a single specific monomer. Due to this unspecific biochemistry, it is not possible to specifically measure lignin decomposition speed by a pool dilution method. Nevertheless, the ratio between glucose depolymerization and respiration allows an estimation, to which extent non-glucose carbon is respired by litter microbes. 

<P>
Several independend methods show similar indication: analytical pyrolysis, calculation of non-glucose respiration, potential enzyme activities. 

<P>
The model by [<A
 HREF="node27.html#Klotzbucher2011">Klotzb&#252;cher et&nbsp;al.(2011)Klotzb&#252;cher, Kaiser, Guggenberger,
  Gatzek and Kalbitz</A>] seems fit for one litter type, but not for the other three.

<P>
No single factor (N content, DOC, P, ...) could explain this differences:

<P>
(1) Micronutrients are nessesary cofactors for oxidative enzymes and have different contents in the four litter types. Their availability can limit lignin degradation [lit]. However, in AK, their concentration in lower  (Mn, Fe) or equal (Zn) concentrations than in other litter types. Low contents of these Elements would explain inhibited, not enhance lignin decomposition in AK.

<P>
(2) Litter nitrogen content was strictly correlated to most decomposition processes measured (enzymes, N-depoly, Glucose-depoly, ...) after 6 month and [test!]correlated to respiration at earlier harvest. There is a direct control of N content over decomposition processes. The system is N limited, at least after 6 month. However, N content is similar in AK and OS. 

<P>
(3) Higher DOC quantity in SW and AK leads to different trends: in SW lig is accumulated, in AK not.
