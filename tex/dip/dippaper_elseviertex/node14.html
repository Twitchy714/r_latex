Litter mass loss and respiration</A>
</H3>

<P>
Litter massloss was not significant after 2 weeks and 3 month, significant for 2 litter types after 6 month. After 15 month, litter mass loss was significant for all litter types, and strongly correlated to litter N content (R=0.794, p=***). Detailed results were reported by Mooshammer2011. After 15 month, between 5 and 12% of the initial dry mass was lost. This is less than reported in litter decomposition studies on other species, but in a similar range as recently reported for beech litter from an in-situ litterbag study Kalbitz2006 .

<P>
Highest respiration rates were measured after 14 days incubation (150-350 &#181;g CO<SUB>2</SUB>-C d-1 g-1 litter-C), dropped to rates between between 75 and 100 &#181;g CO<SUB>2</SUB>-C d-1 g-1 litter-C after 97 days. After 181 and 375 days, respiration rates for AK and OS further decreased, while SW and KL show a secound maximal respiration after 181 days. [make graph!] Respiration was correlated to litter N content after 2 weeks, 6 and 15 month(R&gt;0.70 in all cases, all p=***), but not after 3 month. All harvests combined were weakly correlated to litter N content (R=0.416, p=***).

<P>
Accumulated respiration was correlated to litter massloss for all harvest witbh significant mass loss when means per litter type and harvest were compared (n=6) [statistics]. Slope was [&lt;1] indicating a general underestimation of CO2-C [check]. Nevertheless, due to the high correlations to mass loss after 6 and 15 month, it can be assumed that the amounts of accumulated respiration calculated allow comparing litter decomposition rates between different harvests and litter types.
