Using analytical pyrolysis to analyse samples from a litter decomposition experiment, we could show that (1) early lignin decomposition as described by \cite{Koltzbucher2011}, but only under C-rich N-poor conditions, and (2) the model proposed by \cite{Fontaine2011} is applicable to litter lignin and cellulose pools≈õ and for natural (unfertilized) stoichiometrical differences.
