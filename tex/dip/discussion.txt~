\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Intra-specific variance in beech litter and decomposition trends .. }

We find characteristic patterns in pyrolysis products from different sites. Most important differences were found in furan-type carbohydrate products and 


\subsection{Nutrient controls on carbon chemistry}

Early lignin decomposition could be shown for the litter type with the lowest N and P (AK) concentrations, while other types show similar preference for carbohydrates over lignin. 

Several independend methods show similar indication: analytical pyrolysis, calculation of non-glucose respiration, potential enzyme activities.

We discarded several other reasons for elevated lignin degradation in AK: Micronutrients are available in lower (Cu, Fe) or equal (Zn) concentrations in AK than in other litter types, therefore a possible stimulation of these elements on lignin oxidation would favor the oposite tren .
