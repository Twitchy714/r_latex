\section{Introduction}
The lack of reliable methods for lignin quantification led to the application of analytical pyrolysis as a cheap and fast method to estimate fibre content and nutrient quality of forage material. 

Analytical pyrolysis is frequently applied to characterize soil organic matter. Interpretation of pyrolysis products is often based on their origin from plant polymers. For example, \cite{Schellekens2007} compares pyrolysis products from SOM from a soil profile to pyrolysis products of local vegetation to reconstruct past vegetation. 

However, the decomposition dynamics, from which pyrolysis products result are far from elucidated. While assignment to major compounds classes (like ligin or carbohydrate) based on pyrolysis reaction mechnisms is common, little is known on whether the composition of individual pyrolysis products within this groups yields information. 

The only pyrolysis study directly studying the decay of plant litter is \cite{Franchini2002}. In a number of cases, litter was mixed with soils to follow decomposition by GC/MS. Straw was incubated with n. n. ...

This study compares pyrograms of beech litter from different site after up to 15 month of decomposition. Beech litter has an exceptionally slow decomposition both in nature \citep{Klotzbucher2011} and in our climate chamber experiment. However, several 

Inter-site comparison of litter traits within a given species give a 

\section{Material and Methods}

We analyzed samples from a litter decomposition experiment with Pyr-GC/MS. Beech litter from 4 different sites in Austria was collected in October 2008, cut to pieces \textless 0.5 cm, homogenized, sterilized and inoculated with a common inoculate for all sites. Litter was incubated in a climate chamber at 15 \textdegree C and was kept at 60 \% moisture \citep{Wanek2010}.
Total mass loss after 15 month was between 7 and 15 \%.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Pyrolysis products}

A total of 128 pyrolysis products were identified and quantified.

\subsection{Lignin and other Phenoles}

Pyrolysis products of lignin are 2-methoxyphenol (guaiacol) and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (syringol) with alkyl chains of up to 3 C-atoms at C$_4$.

A total of 38 phenolic pyrolysis products were identified, of which 15 had guaiacol and 13 syringol and 10 non-methoxylated phenol ring systems. Guaiacol/Syringol (G/S) ratios were tightly (all R=0.68-0.94, p<0.001) correlated between the more abundant side chains (-H, -CH$_3$, -CH$_2$CH$_3$, -CH=CH$_2$, -CH$_3$CH=CH$_2$). This correlation is weaker or non-significant for less abundant side chains (-CHO, -CH$_2$CH$_2$CHO), probably due to higher variances in their detection [see fig.,]. 

Part of non-methoxylated phenols pyrolysis products (side chains -CH$_2$CH$_3$, -CH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_3$ -CH$_3$CH=CH$_2$)show clear structural similarity to pyrolysis products of lignin, suggesting that they are pyrolysis products of p-hydroxypropanylphenol based lignin. Other side chains (-H, -CH$_3$, -CHO) are less specific and are reported for other sources, although in small amounts. Furthermore, some of the phenolic compounds (i.e. hydroxyquinone) are not lignin derived. 


The pattern of abundances of different side chains was the same for guaiacol and syringol derived compounds. Fig \ref{sidechainratios}shows that the ratios between 15 pairs of side chains are highly significant in guaiacol and syringol lignin based pyrolysis products. However, there are some site-specific differences in these patterns: the abundance of -H and -CH$_3$ side chains relative to other side chains is different between the litter types, but consistent between guaiacol and syringol derivatives. 
  de chains with oxygen based functional groups were present, but in abundances much lower than the before mentioned. 

\subsection{N compounds}

11 N containing compounds were identified. They were tightly correlated to each other, especially methylindol and indole (R=0.98, p\textless 0.05?0.001?). and 6 pyridin and pyrrol derivatives (all R \textgreater 0.9, p\textless 0.05?0.001?). The two groups were correlated to each other (R = 0.77-0.87, p\textless 0.05?0.001?). 2 pyrrol derivatices (N-methyl-pyrrol and methylpyrrol[II]) and pyridol showed were not or less strict correlated to the other compounds, due to low abundance. Furthermore, all N markers except the three mentioned before were correlated to litter N content (R \textgreater 0.81, p \textless 0.001.


While N compounds generally increase in 

Pyridol looses during first three month, then follows generall N trend.

\subsection{Carbohydrates}
In total, 42 carbohydrate derived pyrolysis products were identified either by their structure or by comparison to reference material (celluluse, xylran, glucose, ...). Unlike lignin or N compounds, carbohydrate pyrolysis products do not follow a common trend, but - reflecting the differences within this group, 


Furanmethanol shows an especially high degradation rate, loosing 15 to 30 \% of it's initial contribution to the total peak area over 15 month.


\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Lignin side chains}
Until now, studies following lignin degradation with Pyr-GC/MS \citep{ were focusing on changes between the frequency of lignin pyrolysis products, only the ratio between guaiacol/syringol/phenol based ring system was investigated. We found substantial differences in the frequency of different lignin side chains between litter collected at different sites. We found that these differences remained nearly constant during during 15 month of litter decomposition.

In both syringol and gaiacol the ratio between the abundances of pyrolysis products is the same.

Guaiacol to Syringol ratios were constant over decomposition time. 

Most important differences between sites were observed in the ratio between Guaiacol
