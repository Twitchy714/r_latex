abstract = {In this work a method for the quantification of the lignin content (Py-lignin) of Maritime pine and spruce wood samples directly from the pyrograms is presented. The precision of the Py-lignin method was 0.41 \% for Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) and 0.34\% for spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst), close to the stated repeatability of the reference Klason method (0.34\%). Besides apparent species-specific deviations, an average difference of 3.9 +/- 0.72\% compared to the Klason lignin content was observed. Py-lignin retains between 70 (Maritime pine) and 89\% (spruce) of the variation in the lignin amount found for the same samples by the Klason lignin method. Good correlation was found between the Py-lignin and Klason lignin content, for both species but a good common model to both species was also found, which allows to calculate the Klason lignin content from Py-lignin content for both species using only one model.

abstract = {The pyrolysis of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) of the cultivar, "Cave-in-Rock" harvested at three stages of physiological maturity was studied in a PY-GC/MS system at the 600-1050 degrees C temperature range. Under these conditions, the decomposition was complete within 20 s yielding char, and two sets of pyrolysis gas, condensable and non-condensable. The former consisted of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), acetic acid (CH3COOH) and higher molecular weight compounds possibly from the hydroxyl group and from the methoxy groups of the cell wall components. The non-condensable gases were mainly CO, CO2 and C-1-C-3 hydrocarbons. For these, there was a 900 degrees C temperature boundary where dramatic change occurred in their evolution rates. Below this temperature, CO2 decreased but CO and the C-1-C-3 hydrocarbons increased almost linearly with temperature. Above this temperature boundary, the hydrocarbons leveled off but there was a rapid rise in CO and CO2 evolution at a constant CO/CO2 ratio. These suggest the appearance of secondary or tertiary pyrolysis reactions involving rearrangement and release of CO and hydrocarbons prior to this temperature boundary and the release of CO and CO2 from the tightly bond oxygen functionalities including C-C bonds thereafter. At \&lt;750 degrees C, there were modest increases in condensable gas yield and decrease in non-condensable gas due to differences in plant maturity at harvest. However, the effect of switchgrass physiological maturity on gas yield was statistically insignificant at high temperatures. The energy content of the non-condensable gas measured was about 68\% of the gross energy content of the biomass for the early harvest crop and 80\% for the mature crop. The activation energy for the decomposition, estimated assuming first order reaction kinetics, showed a linear increase with plant physiological maturity. The results demonstrate that physiological maturity at harvest of switchgrass biomass can result in different concentrations of pyrolysis products at different temperatures. These results also demonstrate the need for additional research with a broader array of herbaceous biomass materials to develop a better understanding of the synergies of crop cultivation, harvesting and processing of dedicated herbaceous biomass energy crops during their thermochemical conversion.

abstract = {Litter decomposition represents one of the largest annual fluxes of carbon (C) from terrestrial ecosystems, particularly for tropical forests, which are generally characterized by high net primary productivity and litter turnover. We used data from the Long-Term Intersite Decomposition Experiment (LIDET) to (1) determine the relative importance of climate and litter quality as predictors of decomposition rates, (2) compare patterns in root and leaf litter decomposition, (3) identify controls on net nitrogen (N) release during decay, and (4) compare LIDET rates with native species studies across five bioclimatically diverse neotropical forests. Leaf and root litter decomposed fastest in the lower montane rain and moist forests and slowest in the seasonally dry forest. The single best predictor of leaf litter decomposition was the climate decomposition index (CDI), explaining 51\% of the variability across all sites. The strongest models for predicting leaf decomposition combined climate and litter chemistry, and included CDI and lignin (R-2=0.69), or CDI, N and nonpolar extractives (R-2=0.69). While we found no significant differences in decomposition rates between leaf and root litter, drivers of decomposition differed for the two tissue types. Initial stages of decomposition, determined as the time to 50\% mass remaining, were driven primarily by precipitation for leaf litter (R-2=0.93) and by temperature for root litter (R-2=0.86). The rate of N release from leaf litter was positively correlated with initial N concentrations; net N immobilization increased with decreasing initial N concentrations. This study demonstrates that decomposition is sensitive to climate within and across tropical forests. Our results suggest that climate change and increasing N deposition in tropical forests are likely to result in significant changes to decomposition rates in this biome.},

abstract = {The chemical composition of leaf fibers of abaca (Musa textilis), which are commonly used for high-quality paper pulp production, was thoroughly studied. The results revealed that the lignin content was 13.2\% of the total fiber. The analysis of abaca fibers by pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) released predominantly compounds arising from lignin and p-hydroxycinnamic acids, with high amounts of 4-vinylphenol. The latter compound was demonstrated to arise from p-coumaric acid by pyrolysis of abaca fibers in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide, which released high amounts of p-coumaric acid (as the methyl derivative). Products from p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) propanoid units, with a predominance of the latter (H:G:S molar ratio of 1.5:1:4.9), were also released after Py-GC/MS of abaca fibers. Sinapyl and coniferyl acetates, which are thought to be lignin monomer precursors, were also found in abaca. The extractives content of the abaca fiber (0.4\%) was low, and the most predominant compounds were free sterols (24\% of total extract) and fatty acids (24\% of total extract). Additionally, significant amounts of steroid ketones (10\%), triglycerides (6\%), omega-hydroxyfatty acids (6\%), monoglycerides (4\%), fatty alcohols (4\%), and a series of p-hydroxycinnamyl (p-coumaric and ferulic acids) esterified with long chain alcohols and omega-hydroxyfatty acids were also found, together with minor amounts of steroid hydrocarbons, diglycerides, alpha-hydroxyfatty acids, sterol esters, and sterol glycosides.},

abstract = {A multi-site and multi-age set of in situ N-15-labelled litter decomposition experiments was carried out in various European beech forests. The sites presented contrasted situations of climate and humus type that were representative of northern Europe temperate forests. N-15-labelled leaf litter was produced by urea spraying in an experimental beech plot, and was used in litter decomposition experiments over a 3-6-year period, depending on the site. Schemes of decomposition covered a wide range of situations, some of them not expected, like high decay rate on Moder humus forms or slow decomposition on Mull humus form. The objectives of this study were to determine how nitrogen release and/or incorporation rates could characterize litter decomposition dynamics. A carbon and nitrogen coupled model of decomposition based on the quality theory was used to fit the given data. High correlation coefficients and unbiased fitting were obtained both for carbon (R-2 = 0.96,p \&lt;= 0.0001, n = 392) and nitrogen (R-2 = 0.86,p \&lt;= 0.0001, n = 367). The theoretical concept of quality was somewhat lightened and related to decomposer activity: low rates of quality decrease were associated with high decomposition rates, showing that when decomposers are sufficiently supplied with labile carbon from the humus they decompose litter more completely than when they are carbon limited. Provided that the degrading substrate stoichiometry was kept constant (i.e. C loss / N loss ratio), the same litter decomposition could be processed at different rates. Taking seasonal variations of the parameters into account is likely to improve our understanding, but further experiments at more frequent intervals are needed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Finzi2006,
abstract = {A hypothesis for progressive nitrogen limitation (PNL) proposes that net primary production (NPP) will decline through time in ecosystems subjected to a step-function increase in atmospheric CO2. The primary mechanism driving this response is a rapid rate of N immobilization by plants and microbes under elevated CO2 that depletes soils of N, causing slower rates of N mineralization. Under this hypothesis, there is little long-term stimulation of NPP by elevated CO2 in the absence of exogenous inputs of N. We tested this hypothesis using data on the pools and fluxes of C and N in tree biomass, microbes, and soils from 1997 through 2002 collected at the Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment. Elevated CO2 stimulated NPP by 18-24\% during the first six years of this experiment. Consistent with the hypothesis for PNL, significantly more N was immobilized in tree biomass and in the O horizon under elevated CO2. In contrast to the PNL hypothesis, microbial-N immobilization did not increase under elevated CO2, and although the rate of net N mineralization declined through time, the decline was not significantly more rapid under elevated CO2. Ecosystem C-to-N ratios widened more rapidly under elevated CO2 than ambient CO2 indicating a more rapid rate of C fixation per unit of N, a processes that could delay PNL in this ecosystem. Mass balance calculations demonstrated a large accrual of ecosystem N capital. Is PNL occurring in this ecosystem and will NPP decline to levels under ambient CO2? The answer depends on the relative strength of tree biomass and O-horizon N immobilization vs. widening C-to-N ratios and ecosystem-N accrual as processes that drive and delay PNL, respectively. Only direct observations through time will definitively answer this question.},

To date, however, reports are scarce and sometimes contradictory, and suffer from methodological problems. Only in a single cephalopod species has the chitin been identified as beta-chitin. We present data on chitin occurrence in 22 species of shell-bearing Mollusca (Conchifera) and Polyplacophora, including the first evidence for scaphopods, based on pyrolysis gas chromatography, mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Pyrolysis GC-MS detected chitin in every tested member of the Conchifera. IR spectroscopy before and after chitinase treatment revealed at least three distinct patterns of peak changes. The contents of the insoluble shell organics included not only chitin and proteins, but also insoluble polysaccharides, e.g., glucan. We conclude that chitin was present in the last common ancestor of the Conchifera and that its abundance in the shell matrix depends on the differentiation of the shell.},

abstract = {We present a method for determining the natural abundance radiocarbon (14C) content of soil microbial biomass (SMB) based on existing fumigation–extraction procedures. We applied the technique to soils from the foreland of the \"{O}denwinkelkees glacier in the Austrian Alps, which has a well-characterised chronosequence of soils at different stages of development. Across the chronosequence, SMB contained post-bomb levels of 14C, suggesting it was substantially composed of carbon that had been fixed since the 1960s. Comparison of our results with previous findings from the same site showed that at most stages in the sequence the SMB had a similar 14C content to the bulk soil organic matter (SOM). However, soil respired CO2 was 14C-depleted relative to SMB, indicating that at least a component of the microbial community was mineralising some older carbon. In the most recently exposed soils, SMB was 14C-enriched compared to both soil respiration and SOM, suggesting that a small component of the microbial biomass that utilises older carbon contributes disproportionately more to the CO2 efflux. Although other interpretations are possible, this explanation is consistent with the notion that early on in the succession a large proportion of the microbial biomass is dormant.},

abstract = {Summary When modelling the carbon dynamics of temperate soils, soil organic carbon (SOC) is often represented by three kinetic pools, i.e. fast, slow and passive/inert. Lignin is often considered to be relatively resistant to decomposition, thus possibly contributing to the passive SOC pool. One way to assess SOC turnover under natural conditions is to follow the fate of 13C-labelled biomass in soils. We used compound-specific isotope analysis to analyse CuO oxidation products of lignin from grassland topsoils and from an arable topsoil that had received a natural (by C3-C4 vegetation change) or an artificial (by fumigation with labelled CO2) isotopic label for 9-23 years. Results indicate faster apparent turnover for lignin (5-26 years in grassland, 9-38 years in arable soil) compared with bulk SOC (20-26 years in grassland, 51 years in arable soil). Although these calculated lignin turnover times cannot be extrapolated to the whole soil profiles, this paper provides isotopic evidence that lignin in soils is not preferentially preserved, which is a consistent result from both ways of isotopic labelling. It also demonstrates, however, that a considerable proportion of lignin in temperate soils can be stabilized for at least a few decades.},

abstract = {The phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers 18:1 9, 18:2 6,9 and 18:3 3,6,9 are commonly used as fungal biomarkers in soils. They have, however, also been found to occur in plant tissues, such as roots. Thus, the use of these PLFAs as fungal biomarkers in sieved soil, which may still contain small remains of roots, has been questioned. We used data from a recent beech tree girdling experiment to calculate the contribution of roots to these biomarkers and were able to demonstrate that not more than 0.61\% of 18:1 9 and 18:2 6,9 in sieved soil samples originated from roots (but 4\% of 18:3 3,6,9). Additionally, the abundance of the biomarker 18:2 6,9 in the soil was found to be highly correlated to ectomycorrhizal root colonization, which further corroborates its fungal origin. PLFA biomarkers were substantially reduced in vital roots from girdled trees compared to roots of control trees (by up to 76\%), indicating that the major part of PLFAs measured in roots may actually originate from ectomycorrhizal fungi growing inside the roots. Wecalculated, that even a near to 50\% reduction in fine root biomass as observed in the girdling treatment accounted for only 0.8\% of the measured decrease of 18:2 6,9. Our results demonstrate thatboth 18:1 9 and 18:2 6,9 are suitable biomarkers for detecting fungal dynamics in soils and that especially 18:2 6,9 is a reliable biomarker to study mycorrhizal dynamics in beech forests.},

abstract = {The characterization of solid wastes is a necessary step before they can be used in anaerobic digestion. The quantities of different compounds (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and fibers) and anaerobic biodegradability (capacity to produce methane) are important information required to characterize waste. The Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) test is one of the most relevant tests for assessing the biodegradability of waste materials. The BMP test is run under anaerobic conditions, using bacteria populations, which makes it very time consuming, i.e., about 30 days. This paper presents alternative methods for determining the anaerobic biodegradability of solid waste. First, we describe the already existing tests for characterizing organic matter. Then we correlate an aerobic test with an anaerobic test in order to estimate anaerobic biodegradability and biogas production. This shortens the analysis time to 5 days. Models using physico-chemical characteristics as input data (total carbohydrate, total nitrogen, fiber, etc.) can predict the amount of methane produced by correlation. Pyrolysis is a very fast analytical test that can be used to characterize solid waste. Lastly, spectroscopy techniques seem to be useful for determining biodegradability, in particular by taking into account the interaction between different molecules in the organic matter.

abstract = {Selective modification/degradation of the main plant polymers (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) was investigated in a hardwood after white and brown-rot fungal decay under environmental conditions. The chemical changes produced in the plant cell wall were analysed in situ, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the gel state, and analytical pyrolysis. Two-dimensional (2D) NMR of the white-rotted wood showed only cellulose and (deacetylated) hemicellulose, and the complete removal of lignin. On the other hand, the brown-rotted wood showed the nearly complete absence of polysaccharides, while the main features of lignin structure, as revealed by 2D-NMR, could be observed. These included well-resolved aromatic and side-chain cross-signals, although the intensity of the latter signals was lowered indicating a reduction in the number of side-chain linkages ($\beta$-O-4' and $\beta$-$\beta$') per aromatic unit (their relative abundances remaining unchanged). These results contrast with a recent study concluding that the aromatic polymer after brown-rot decay is not longer recognized as lignin. Some oxidative alteration of lignin during brown-rot decay was evidenced and, more interesting, several compounds with 3-methoxycatechol skeleton were released upon pyrolysis. Lignin demethylation is consistent with recent brown-rot transcriptomic/secretomic studies showing overexpression of methanol oxidase, which could use lignin-derived methanol to generate the peroxide required for cellulose depolymerization via Fenton chemistry.},

abstract = {A collection of tannins extracted from various plant species was subjected to thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) using tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The products obtained included 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzenes, derived from A rings of condensed tannins (CTs), and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene, and derivatives as major products from the B ring. 1,2,4-Tri- and two tetramethoxybenzenes were also detected in most analyses. Correlation analyses revealed that they were derived from the B ring, with 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene being derived from a procyanidin (PC) B ring and 1,2,3,5-tetramethoxybenzene from a prodelphinidin (PD) ring. Tannins from species that contained both CT and hydrolyzable tannin (HT) produced mainly permethylated gallic acid moieties upon THM, and the products derived from CTs were less abundant. Most likely, the ester-bound HTs are more easily transmethylated than the cleavage and methylation of the C-C and C-O linked CTs. Statistical analyses of the THM products and 13C NMR data of the tannins showed good correlations between the B ring hydroxylation and the di- and trimethoxybenzenes observed. Using the ratio of the methyl esters of 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid only provided good correlations of the percent PC as well. Furthermore, the 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzenes may serve as good markers of tannins in plant, soil, sediment or other samples as analyzed by THM.},

abstract = {The flow of carbon and nutrients from plant production into detrital food webs is mediated by microbial enzymes released into the environment (ecoenzymes). Ecoenzymatic activities are linked to both microbial metabolism and environmental resource availability. In this paper, we extend the theoretical and empirical framework for ecoenzymatic stoichiometry from nutrient availability to carbon composition by relating ratios of $\beta$-1,4-glucosidase (BG), acid (alkaline) phosphatase (AP), $\beta$-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and phenol oxidase (POX) activities in soils to measures of organic matter recalcitrance, using data from 28 ecosystems. BG and POX activities are uncorrelated even though both are required for lignocellulose degradation. However, the ratio of BG:POX activity is negatively correlated with the relative abundance of recalcitrant carbon. Unlike BG, POX activity is positively correlated with (NAG + LAP) and AP activities. We propose that the effect of organic matter recalcitrance on microbial C:N and C:P threshold element ratios (TER) can be represented by normalizing BG, AP and (NAG + LAP) activities to POX activity. The scaling relationships among these ratios indicate that the increasing recalcitrance of decomposing organic matter effectively reverses the growth rate hypothesis of stoichiometric theory by decreasing carbon and nutrient availability and slowing growth, which increases TERN:P. This effect is consistent with the narrow difference between the mean elemental C:N ratios of soil organic matter and microbial biomass and with the inhibitory effect of N enrichment on rates of decomposition and microbial metabolism for recalcitrant organic matter. From these findings, we propose a conceptual framework for bottom-up decomposition models that integrate the stoichiometry of ecoenzymatic activities into general theories of ecology.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is a key factor in ecosystem dynamics. A better understanding of the global relationship between environmental characteristics, ecosystems and SOM chemistry is vital in order to assess its specific influence on carbon cycles. This study compared the composition of extracted SOM in 18 topsoil samples taken under tundra, taiga, steppe, temperate forest and tropical forest using pyrolysis-GC/MS. Results indicate that SOM from cold climates (tundra, taiga) still resembles the composition of litter, evidenced by high quantities of levosugars and long alkanes relative to N-compounds and a clear odd-over-even dominance of the longer alkanes. Under temperate conditions, increased microbial degradation generally results in a more altered SOM chemistry. SOM formed under temperate coniferous forests shows an accumulation of aromatic and aliphatic moieties, probably induced by substrate limitations. Tropical SOM was characterized by an SOM composition rich in N-compounds and low in lignins, without any accumulation of recalcitrant fractions (i.e. aliphatic and aromatic compounds). Lignin composition moreover varies according to vegetation type. Results were validated against 13 new samples. The humic signature of topsoil organic matter formed under different biomes indicates a dominating effect of (i) SOM input composition related to vegetation, and (ii) SOM breakdown reflecting both climate and input quality. No evidence was found for a chemically stabilized SOM fraction under favorable decomposition conditions (temperate or warm climate with broadleaved vegetation). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The chemical transformations that occur during growth of the shiitake mushroom (Lentinula edodes) on oak (Quercus alba) were investigated to improve mushroom cultivation and utilization of the spent substrate. Oak logs were decayed by L. edodes over 8 years, during which time they were sampled at six intervals (30, 40, 66, 76, 77, and 101 months). Fresh and decayed oak samples were analyzed using solid-state (13)C NMR and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as well as off-line thermochemolysis with tetramethylammonium hydroxide. Degraded oak exhibited lower carbon contents and increased oxygen content compared to the control. Solid-state (13)C NMR analysis revealed that polysaccharides were the major component of both fresh and decayed oak but that L. edodes mediated the preferential loss of cellulose and xylans as compared to lignin, which remained in an altered form. Several trends point toward the degradation of lignin, including a decrease in the proportion of syringyl units as compared to guaiacyl units and a reduction in side-chain length. An increase in guaiacyl and syringyl acid-to-aldehyde ratios occurred with growth, which suggested that the fungus had caused oxidation of Calpha-Cbeta bonds. The overall effect of L. edodes on oak is similar to that of many white-rot fungi, which simultaneously degrade all cell wall components.},

abstract = {Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) using a vertical furnace pyrolyzer was applied to the characterization of internal wood degradation in Platanus acerifolia. Wood disks from approximately 92-year-old tree, previously cut down and showing a large infection caused by wood-rotting fungi, were analysed to determine lignin pyrolysis products composition and syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio. Similar phenolic compounds were found in the sound and extensively degraded wood, as well as in wood samples collected in R-zone, which separate sound and decayed wood. Significant variation of S/G ratio versus wood degradation, instead, was observed. The values showed a decrease of 27.1\% from sound to decayed wood revealing a structural fungal degradation of lignin. Furthermore, a less extensive drop (13.7\%) of S/G ratio in the R-zone, in comparison with the sound wood, was observed. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the relative peak areas of the 23 identified pyrolysis products. The differentiation between sound and decayed wood was observed in the plot of the two first components as well as the correlation between pyrolysis products was discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Radiocarbon (14C) dating of total soil organic matter (SOM) often yields results inconsistent with the stratigraphic sequence. The onerous chemical extractions for SOM fractions do not always produce satisfactory 14C dates. In an effort to develop an alternative method, the pyrolysis-combustion technique was investigated to partition SOM into pyrolysis volatile (Py-V) and pyrolysis residue (Py-R) fractions. The Py-V fractions obtained from a thick glacigenic loess succession in Illinois yielded 14C dates much younger but more reasonable than the counterpart Py-R fractions for the soil residence time. Carbon isotopic composition 13C) was heavier in the Py-V fractions, suggesting a greater abundance of carbohydrate- and protein-related constituents, and 13C was lighter in the Py-R fractions, suggesting more ligninand lipid-related constituents. The combination of 14C dates and 13C values indicates that the Py-V fractions are less biodegradation resistant and the Py-R fractions are more biodegradation resistant. The pyrolysis-combustion method provides a less cumbersome approach for 14C dating of SOM fractions. With further study, this method may become a useful tool for analyzing unlithified terrestrial sediments when macrofossils are absent.},

abstract = {A range of spectroscopic, `wet' chemical, gas chromatographic (GC) and mass spectrometric (MS) techniques was applied to the characterisation of three soil organic matter (SOM) fractions that have been proposed as the basis. of a new SOM turnover model based on measurable, physically defined fractions. The fractions were: the free light fraction (obtained by density separation in NaI solution at a density of 1.80 g cm(-3), without disruption of aggregates), the intra-aggregate light fraction (obtained using a second density separation after disrupting aggregates using ultrasonic dispersion) and the organomineral fraction corresponding to the residual heavy material. The techniques employed to investigate the composition of the organic constituents of each fraction were: C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) to study bulk composition. Lipid, lignin and carbohydrate fractions were assessed using GC and GC/MS with appropriate derivatisation, following oxidative and hydrolytic treatments, respectively, in the case of the latter two classes. Proteinaceous components were determined as amino acids using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) following 6 M HCl treatment and derivatisation. Each technique revealed marked differences in chemical composition between the organomineral and the two light fractions with the results being consistent with the organomineral fraction having different biological sources or having undergone a greater degree of degradation or transformation. Several techniques detected differences between the composition of the free light fraction and the intra-aggregate light fraction. With the exception of carbohydrate composition, the results were consistent with the order of reactivity previously proposed from incubation studies with isotopically labelled substrates, namely: free \&gt; intra-aggregate \&gt; organomineral. The investigation illustrates the importance of using a range of different chemical characterisation techniques in studies of complex SOM fractions as each has limitations that could, if used alone, produce ambiguous findings or fail to detect differences between them.

The ''reducing'' end groups are at least partly in the form of methyl xylosides. Vacuum pyrolysis of the pure synthetic xylan gave a high char yield (48\%, compare, for example 5\% from pure cellulose), 1,4-anhydro-alpha-D-xylopyranose (5.7\%), and 1,5-anhydro-4-deoxypent-1-en-3-ulose (2.4\%). The structure of the latter compound was verified by degradation experiments and it was shown to be the compound previously isolated from pyrolysis of natural xylans and incorrectly assigned as 3-hydroxy-2-penteno- 1,5-lactone. This glyculose has considerable importance as a marker compound for xylans in pyrolysis of biomass materials.},

abstract = {Declining cell wall degradability of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) steins with maturation limits the nutritional value of alfalfa for ruminants. This study characterized changes in cell wall concentration, composition, and degradability by rumen microbes resulting from alfalfa stem tissue proliferation and development during maturation. The seventh internode from the shoot base of three alfalfa clones was sampled after 12, 17, 21, 31, and 87 d of regrowth in 1996 and 21 and 31 d in 1997. Cross sections v ere examined by light microscopy for tissue development, and after 48-h in vitro degradation. Cell wall concentration and composition of the internodes were determined by the Uppsala dietary fiber method, and cell wall degradability by rumen microbes was measured after 12 and 96 h. All stem tissues were pectin-rich and nonlignified at the two youngest maturities in 1996, except for primary xylem vessels which had lignified and thickened walls, and the internode was actively elongating. Primary xylem was the only tissue not degraded from immature stems. The 21-d-old internodes had completed elongation and begun secondary xylem proliferation. Secondary xylem lignified immediately, and lignification of primary phloem and pith parenchyma began when elongation ended. As tissues lignified, their cell walls became undegradable. Maturation increased stem proportion consisting of undegradable secondary xylem, and cell wall polysaccharide composition shifted from predominantly, pectin toward cellulose. Degradability of pectin remained high regardless of maturity stage, but cellulose and hemicellulose degradabilities declined as secondary xylem proliferated. Degradability of alfalfa stems would be improved if the amount of lignified secondary xylem was reduced.},

abstract = {Humic acids have been widely investigated by spectroscopic methods. especially NMR and FTIR, and they are known to show significant differences according to their origin. Low resolution methods such as NMR and FTIR. however cannot easily distinguish different input sources or establish relations between SOM chemistry and vegetation or land use in general. High resolution methods, such as analytical pyrolysis and pyrolysis combined with methylation do offer such possibilities. Therefore, HAs from five reference soils called the Eurosoils, including a Vertic Cambisol (E1, Italy), a Rendzina (E2, Greece), a Dystic Cambisol (E3, Great Britain), an Orthic Luvisol (E4, France) and an Orthic Podzol (E5, Germany), that were previously characterized a.o. by NMR, FTIR and ESR, were also analyzed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) and subsequent analysis by GC/MS. The Orthic Podzol sample showed the largest aliphaticity, and the strongest degradation of aliphatics and lignin. The Dystric Cambisol featured the least decomposed HA, which was reflected by a large content of long-chain alkanes, and little lignin degradation. Both the Dystric Cambisol and the Orthic Luvisol HAs contained a significant amount of microbial organic matter. Polyaromatics, which indicate the presence of charred material, were most abundant in the Vertic Cambisol and the Podzol HAs and lowest in the Dystric Cambisol and the Rendzina HAs. THM was able to distinguish between the various vegetations/land uses. Although quantifications by NMR and py-GC/MS are essentially different, the general results largely coincided. NMR appears to underestimate aromaticity and overestimate aliphaticity, but a molecular mixing model yielded reasonable correlations between NMR and pyrolysis data. Classification by 'degradation state' based on py-GC/MS largely coincided with acidity determined by titration, but FTIR data did not coincide. Py-GC/MS, with its much larger resolution, is a better tool to distinguish effects of vegetation, microbial input, and degradation. HA's produce the same variety of compounds upon pyrolysis as total SOM extracts and are therefore chemically not more simple than SOM. HA chemistry, however can be understood in the light of land use history and SOM dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We used sugar maple litter double-labeled with C-13 and N-15 to quantify fluxes of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) between litter and soil in a northern hardwood forest and the retention of litter C and N in soil. Two cohorts of litter were compared, one in which the label was preferentially incorporated into non-structural tissue and the other structural tissue. Loss of C-13 from this litter generally followed dry mass and total C loss whereas loss of N-15 (20-30\% in 1 year) was accompanied by large increases of total N content of this decaying litter (26-32\%). Enrichment of C-13 and N-15 was detected in soil down to 10-15 cm depth. After 6 months of decay (November-May) 36-43\% of the C-13 released from the litter was recovered in the soil, with no differences between the structural and non-structural labeled litter. By October the percentage recovery of litter C-13 in soil was much lower (16\%). The C released from litter and remaining in soil organic matter (SOM) after 1 year represented over 30 g C m(-2) y(-1) of SOM accumulation. Recovery of litter N-15 in soil was much higher than for C (over 90\%) and in May N-15 was mostly in organic horizons whereas by October it was mostly in 0-10 cm mineral soil. A small proportion of this N was recovered as inorganic N (2-6\%). Recovery of N-15 in microbial biomass was higher in May (13-15\%) than in October (about 5\%). The C:N ratio of the SOM and microbial biomass derived from the labeled litter was much higher for the structural than the non-structural litter and for the forest floor than mineral SOM, illustrating the interactive role of substrates and microbial activity in regulating the C:N stoichiometry of forest SOM formation. These results for a forest ecosystem long exposed to chronically high atmospheric N deposition (ca. 10 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) suggest possible mechanisms of N retention in soil: increased organic N leaching from fresh litter and reduced fungal transport of N from soil to decaying litter may promote N stabilization in mineral SOM even at a relatively low C:N ratio.},

The decomposition patterns of the lignins studied were different, the largest differences between the methods being obtained for the spruce needles. Depending on the method used, between 36 and 46\% of the original amount of lignin remained in the pine needles and about 30–61\% in the spruce needles after 3 yr of decomposition. The decomposition rates of the various lignin pools were highly correlated with the loss in mass of the litter. The phloroglucinol lignin was decomposed significantly faster (P < 0.001) in the spruce needles than in the pine needles for as long as the decomposition process was followed. During decomposition of the litter, the residual amount of Klason lignin was correlated with the residual amounts of the other lignins. The application of the different methods to litter decomposition studies is discussed.},

abstract = {Each plant species has a unique chemical composition, and also within a given plant the various tissues differ from one another in their chemistry. These different compositions can be traced back after decay of the plant parts when they are transformed into soil organic matter (SOM). As a result, the composition of SOM reflects not only the plant origin, but also the various tissues, and the composition consequently provides an estimate of the contribution of above-ground vs. below-ground litter. From the latter distribution the extent of bioturbation (mixing of above-ground litter with the mineral soil) can be assessed. Application of thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) releases all typical cutin- and suberin-derived aliphatic monomers (mono-, di- and trihydroxyalkanoic acids, alpha,omega-alkanedioic acids) as their methyl esters and/or ethers in a rapid manner. Using the distribution of omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids that are present in pine needle cutin (C(12) and C(14)) and not in root suberin, and those that are present in roots but not in needles (C(20) and C(22)), the extent of bioturbation (mixing of above-ground plant litter with the mineral soil) can be assessed. Similarly, the (9,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid+9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadecanoic acid)/(C(20) + C(22) alpha,omega-alkanedioic acids) ratio reflects the degree of bioturbation. Three mineral soil profiles under Corsican pine with an A horizon that exhibited extensive bioturbation phenomena, and underlying C horizons with hardly any or no bioturbation, were investigated in order to examine the applicability of such an approach. It appeared that the A horizons contained all four mentioned omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids, while the C horizons contained virtually only the C(20) and C(22) members. The results not only suggest that bioturbation occurs in the A horizons, but also that possible illuviation or other transport mechanisms of omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids seem hardly ever or never to occur, which is a prerequisite for applying this biomarker approach in assessing degrees of bioturbation.},

@article{Sinsabaugh2010,
abstract = {Extracellular enzymes mediate the degradation, transformation and mineralization of soil organic matter. The activity of cellulases, phosphatases and other hydrolases has received extensive study and in many cases stoichiometric relationships and responses to disturbances are well established. In contrast, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities, which are often uncorrelated with hydrolase activities, have been measured in only a small subset of soil enzyme studies. These enzymes are expressed for a variety of purposes including ontogeny, defense and the acquisition of carbon and nitrogen. Through excretion or lysis, these enzymes enter the environment where their aggegrate activity mediates key ecosystem functions of lignin degradation, humification, carbon mineralization and dissolved organic carbon export. Phenol oxidases and peroxidases are less stable in the environment than extracellular hydrolases, especially when associated with organic particles. Activities are also affected, positively and negatively, by interaction with mineral surfaces. High spatiotemporal variation obscures their relationships with environmental variables and ecological process. Across ecosystems, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities generally increase with soil pH, a finding not predicted from the pH optima of purified enzymes. Activities associated with plant litter and particulate organic matter often correlate with decomposition rates and potential activities generally increase with the lignin and secondary compound content of the material. At the ecosystem scale, nitrogen amendment alters the expression of phenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes more broadly than culture studies imply and these responses correlate with positive and negative changes in litter decomposition rates and soil organic matter content. At the global scale, N amendment of basidiomycete-dominated soils of temperate and boreal forest ecoystems often leads to losses of oxidative enzyme activity, while activities in grassland soils dominated by glomeromycota and ascomycetes show little net response. Land use that leads to loss of soil organic matter tends to increase oxidative activities. Across ecosystems, soil organic matter content is not correlated with mean potential phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities. A multiple regression model that includes soil pH, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and potential phenol oxidase activity accounts for 37\% of the variation in soil organic matter (SOM) content across ecosystems (n = 63); a similar model for peroxidase activity describes 32\% of SOM variance (n = 43). Analysis of residual variation suggest that suites of interacting factors create both positive and negative feedbacks on soil organic matter storage. Soils with high oxygen availability, pH and mineral activity tend to be substrate limited: high in situ oxidative activities limit soil organic matter accumulation. Soils with opposing characteristics are activity limited: low in situ oxidative activities promote soil organic matter storage.},

abstract = {The links among the changes in litter chemistry, the activity of extracellular enzymes and the microbial community composition were observed in Quercus petraea litter. Three phases of decomposition could be distinguished. In the early 4-month stage, with high activities of $\beta$-glucosidase, $\beta$-xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase, 16.4\% of litter was decomposed. Hemicelluloses were rapidly removed while cellulose and lignin degradation was slow. In months 4-12, with high endocellulase and endoxylanase activities, decomposition of cellulose prevailed and 31.8\% of litter mass was lost. After the third phase of decomposition until month 24 with high activity of ligninolytic enzymes, the litter mass loss reached 67.9\%. After 2 years of decay, cellulose decomposition was almost complete and most of the remaining polysaccharides were in the form of hemicelluloses. Fungi largely dominated over bacteria as leaf endophytes and also in the litter immediately before contact with soil, and this fungal dominance lasted until month 4. Bacterial biomass (measured as phospholipid fatty acid content) in litter increased with time but also changed qualitatively, showing an increasing number of Actinobacteria. This paper shows that the dynamics of decomposition of individual litter components changes with time in accordance with the changes in the microbial community composition and its production of extracellular enzymes.},

abstract = {We examined chemical changes from leaf tissue to soil organic matter (SOM) to determine the persistence of plant chemistry into soil aggregate fractions. We characterized a slow (Dicranopteris linearis) and fast-decomposing species (Cheirodendron trigynum) and surface (O), and subsurface (A-horizon) SOM beneath each species using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS), with and without derivatization. The live tissues of Dicranopteris had greater lignin content whereas Cheirodendron had a greater lipid, N-bearing, and polysaccharide component. Despite this difference in leaf chemistry, SOM chemistry was similar between soil aggregate fractions, but different between horizons. The O-horizon contained primarily lignin and polysaccharide biomarkers whereas the A-horizon contained polysaccharide, aromatic, and N-derived compounds, indicating considerable microbial processing of plant litter. The soils beneath Cheirodendron inherited a greater lipid signal composed of cutin and suberin biomarkers whereas the soils beneath Dicranopteris contained greater aromatic biomarker content, possibly derived from plant lignins. The soils beneath both species were more similar to root polysaccharides, lipids, and lignins than aboveground tissue. This study indicates that although plant-derived OM is processed vigorously, species-specific biomarkers and compound class differences persist into these soils and that differences in plant chemical properties may influence soil development even after considerable reworking of plant litter by microorganisms.},

abstract = {Changes in organic composition of crop residues (soybean, radish, white lupine, blue lupine, black oat and mucuna) that are utilized in crop rotations in no-tillage farming systems in the southern part of Brazil were evaluated by analytical flash. pyrolysis. The pyrolysis allowed the identification of five groups of compounds ill the residues: guaiacyl moieties in lignin (Lg), syringyl moities in lignin (Ls), polysaccharide (Ps), chlorophyll (Chl) and fatty acid (Fa) derivatives. The decomposition :rates of the plant residues ranged from 4.7 to 5.9 g kg(-1) day(-1), with a mean value of 5.2 g kg(-1) day(-1), corresponding to a mean loss of 41\% (37-47\%) of the initial biomass after 80 days of incubation. The Ps and lignin contents were strongly affected by incubation; relative lignin content increased at the expense of polysaccharide derivatives. In the original samples, Ps was the principal group of organic compounds in green manure plant materials, with maximum values in blue and white lupine (67\%); after incubation, Ps fractions decreased by 26-51\%, (average 40\%), with the greatest value observed with mucuna and the lowest in white lupine. In soybean plant material the Ps fraction decreased only by 9\%. Greater increases in relative lignin content were observed with Ls (156\%) than with Lg (59\%) derivatives, demonstrating that guaiacyl moieties are easier to biochemically degrade than syringyl moieties. A significant correlation between residue-weight loss and organic groups after 80 days incubation was only found with Ls. Plant materials showing a higher content of syringyl moieties after decomposition might aid ill increasing soil organic matter. Flash pyrolysis was shown to be an adequate technique to follow the process of transformation of plant residues into stabilized soil organic matter. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The pyrolysate of waxy cuticle includes the same compounds but is dominated by wax components which are simply desorbed unchanged under the conditions of pyrolysis. However prior heat treatment of waxy cuticle transforms the pyrolysate so that its chromatogram shows a prominent series of alkene-alkane peaks from C-8 to C-34, typical of fossil leaf cuticles.

abstract = {This work is part of a research program with the general objective of evaluating soil sustainability in areas surrounding hydroelectric reservoirs, which have been planted with riparian forest. The specific aims were: (i) to assess if and how the soil organic matter (SOM) chemical composition has changed in such areas, and (ii) to contribute to the knowledge of SOM chemistry in Brazil. To this end, we sampled litter and soil (Anionic Acrustox) in two adjacent areas: one under native vegetation and another forested with riparian species in 1992. The native vegetation was Brazilian savannah orcerrado. In this case, it was a ‘grassy cerrado’, dominated by grasses with few shrubs. Litter was collected and humic substances were extracted from soil by an alkaline solution. Both were characterised by a combination of cross-polarisation-magic angle spinning (CPMAS) solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and pyrolysis-gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Eight years after forestation, the addition of the forest litter had changed SOM chemical composition. The C input pattern exerted a key role on the observed alterations. In the grassy cerrado, litter addition is predominantly below-ground and the litter is richer in carbohydrate-derived compounds and poorer in lignin moieties. In the forested area, C input is largely above-ground and grass litter has been partially replaced by a relatively more recalcitrant material. As a result, topsoil under forest was chemically strongly different from that under cerrado. Factor analysis indicated that the largest differences were between topsoil under forest and deepest subsoil under cerrado, where there is influence of remaining cerrado-derived C. Both semi-quantification and factor analysis of pyrolysis data gave further insight on the extent of alterations, but more research on such a quantitative approach should be developed to detail its application in SOM studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of scientific publications has traditionally been expressed in terms of citation counts. However, scientific activity has moved online over the past decade. To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network analysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific impact. METHODOLOGY: We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by 39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on the basis of both citation and usage log data. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus be used with caution.},

Litter was collected from 20 common oak (Quercus robur L.) stands in Wales (UK) and placed in litter-decomposition bags. These bags were installed in an oak stand for 3, 6, 12, 21, and 31 months to study the effect of litter quality on decomposition (mass loss) rates and the limit value for a broad-leaf species. Results indicate that the initial decomposition rate is highly correlated with the manganese content of the litter (P = 0.007, R2 = 0.34). In the final stages of decomposition, limit values ranged between 57\% and 95\% of initial litter mass. These estimated limit values were not significantly correlated with initial concentrations of other nutrients. However, Ca concentrations gave a significance level of P = 0.067. Estimated rates of C sequestration in soil ranged from 0.93 to 80.22 g Cm2year1.},

This combined study highlighted the limitation of some of the above methods when applied to ligno-cellulosic materials and the resulting biases and the usefulness of TMAH thermochemolysis. A large difference in composition was observed between bran- and straw-LCS due to a much higher contribution of alkyl moieties in the former. These moieties correspond to fatty acids esterified to the ligno-cellulosic macromolecular structure and such carboxylic functions should play an important role for metal complexation.},

@article{Gill2006,
abstract = {The interaction between nitrogen cycling and carbon sequestration is critical in predicting the consequences of anthropogenic increases in atmospheric CO2 (hereafter, Ca). The progressive N limitation (PNL) theory predicts that carbon sequestration in plants and soils with rising Ca may be constrained by the availability of nitrogen in many ecosystems. Here we report on the interaction between C and N dynamics during a four-year field experiment in which an intact C3/C4 grassland was exposed to a gradient in Ca from 200 to 560 micromol/mol. There were strong species effects on decomposition dynamics, with C loss positively correlated and N mineralization negatively correlated with Ca for litter of the C3 forb Solanum dimidiatum, whereas decomposition of litter from the C4 grass Bothriochloa ischaemum was unresponsive to Ca. Both soil microbial biomass and soil respiration rates exhibited a nonlinear response to Ca, reaching a maximum at approximately 440 micromol/mol Ca. We found a general movement of N out of soil organic matter and into aboveground plant biomass with increased Ca. Within soils we found evidence of C loss from recalcitrant soil C fractions with narrow C:N ratios to more labile soil fractions with broader C:N ratios, potentially due to decreases in N availability. The observed reallocation of N from soil to plants over the last three years of the experiment supports the PNL theory that reductions in N availability with rising Ca could initially be overcome by a transfer of N from low C:N ratio fractions to those with higher C:N ratios. Although the transfer of N allowed plant production to increase with increasing Ca, there was no net soil C sequestration at elevated Ca, presumably because relatively stable C is being decomposed to meet microbial and plant N requirements. Ultimately, if the C gained by increased plant production is rapidly lost through decomposition, the shift in N from older soil organic matter to rapidly decomposing plant tissue may limit net C sequestration with increased plant production.},

abstract = {We examined the rates of lignin decay (dC3/dt) and holocellulose decay (dC2/dt) in aboveground leaf litter of predominately northern conifer forests to test our hypothesis that the rate of lignin decay is a linear function of the lignocellulose index (LCI = lignin/[lignin + holocellulose]). We proposed that lignin decays only when LCI > 0.4 and that LCI cannot exceed 0.7, approximating humus. These constraints suggest that holocellulose content of litter is a control on lignin decay. We evaluated this hypothesis with a set of 112 field studies in two ways, by: (1) comparing simulations from a decomposition model to observations across the full range of litter decay and (2) analyzing the relative rate of lignin decay ([dC3/dt]/[dC2/dt + dC3/dt]) as a function of litter LCI. Simulated dynamics of LCI in decaying litter were highly correlated to observed patterns, particularly when litter fractions of water and ethanol solubles from model output were pooled with holocellulose fractions (mean R2 = 0.87 ± 0.02, P < 0.01). More detailed analyses of 64 of these studies yielded variable relationships between lignin decay rate and litter LCI; a regression based on pooled data (N = 385; total number of observations) from these studies produced a slope and an intercept that were not significantly different from predicted (slope = 2.33, intercept = −0.93). Both site and litter characteristics had significant effects on the proposed LCI threshold for lignin decay (LCI  0.4), but no effects on slope or intercept, suggesting that the proposed lignocellulose control hypothesis is relatively robust across a range of litter and forest types used in this study.},

abstract = {Experimentally increasing atmospheric CO2 often stimulates plant growth and ecosystem carbon (C) uptake. Biogeochemical theory predicts that these initial responses will immobilize nitrogen (N) in plant biomass and soil organic matter, causing N availability to plants to decline, and reducing the long-term CO2-stimulation of C storage in N limited ecosystems. While many experiments have examined changes in N cycling in response to elevated CO2, empirical tests of this theoretical prediction are scarce. During seven years of postfire recovery in a scrub oak ecosystem, elevated CO2 initially increased plant N accumulation and plant uptake of tracer 15N, peaking after four years of CO2 enrichment. Between years four and seven, these responses to CO2 declined. Elevated CO2 also increased N and tracer 15N accumulation in the O horizon, and reduced 15N recovery in underlying mineral soil. These responses are consistent with progressive N limitation: the initial CO2 stimulation of plant growth immobilized N in plant biomass and in the O horizon, progressively reducing N availability to plants. Litterfall production (one measure of aboveground primary productivity) increased initially in response to elevated CO2, but the CO2 stimulation declined during years five through seven, concurrent with the accumulation of N in the O horizon and the apparent restriction of plant N availability. Yet, at the level of aboveground plant biomass (estimated by allometry), progressive N limitation was less apparent, initially because of increased N acquisition from soil and later because of reduced N concentration in biomass as N availability declined. Over this seven-year period, elevated CO2 caused a redistribution of N within the ecosystem, from mineral soils, to plants, to surface organic matter. In N limited ecosystems, such changes in N cycling are likely to reduce the response of plant production to elevated CO2.},

abstract = {Field studies have shown that elevated CO2 can cause increased forest growth over the short term (<6 years) even in the face of N limitation. This is facilitated to some degree by greater biomass production per unit N uptake (lower tissue N concentrations), but more often than not, N uptake is increased with elevated CO2 as well. Some studies also show that N sequestration in the forest floor is increased with elevated CO2. These findings raise the questions of where the "extra" N comes from and how long such growth increases can continue without being truncated by progressive N limitation (PNL). This paper reviews some of the early nutrient cycling literature that describes PNL during forest stand development and attempts to use this information, along with recent developments in soil N research, to put the issue of PNL with elevated CO2 into perspective. Some of the early studies indicated that trees can effectively "mine" N from soils over the long term, and more recent developments in soil N cycling research suggest mechanisms by which this might have occurred. However, both the early nutrient cycling literature and more recent simulation modeling suggest that PNL will at some point truncate the observed increases in growth and nutrient uptake with elevated CO2, unless external inputs of N are increased by either N fixation or atmospheric deposition.},

The temporal dynamics of these plantsoil interactions are, however, unclear. Here, we experimentally manipulated the C and N availability in a beech forest through N fertilization or tree girdling and conducted a detailed analysis of the seasonal pattern of microbial community composition and decomposition processes over 2 yr. We found a strong relationship between microbial community composition and enzyme activities over the seasonal course. Phenoloxidase and peroxidase activities were highest during late summer, whereas cellulase and protease peaked in late autumn. Girdling, and thus loss of mycorrhiza, resulted in an increase in soil organic matter-degrading enzymes and a decrease in cellulase and protease activity. Temporal changes in enzyme activities suggest a switch of the main substrate for decomposition between summer (soil organic matter) and autumn (plant litter). Our results indicate that ectomycorrhizal fungi are possibly involved in autumn cellulase and protease activity. Our study shows that, through belowground C allocation, trees significantly alter soil microbial communities, which may affect seasonal patterns of decomposition processes.},

abstract = {In this study we provide data which support the interpretation that tissues of higher plants can constitute a significant source of the short chain n-alkanes with an even/odd predominance (EOP) found in soil organic matter. Gas chromatographic analyses of vegetation (C3 trees, C4 grasses) and associated soil samples (woodland and grassland) from a study site in central Queensland, Australia, revealed that (1) woody vegetation (leaves) and grasses (leaves, roots) contain short chain n-alkanes (C14−C20) with pronounced EOP and (2) such homologues dominate the n-alkane assemblages in its woodland and grassland soils. The presence of short chain n-alkanes with an EOP in some of the vegetation suggests that these may represent a significant source of such alkanes in the woodland and grassland soils. Previous studies have shown that combustion induced thermal breakdown of long chain n-alkanes may produce short chain homologues with an EOP. A history of repeated bushfires at the study site may have contributed to the presence of these n-alkanes in its soils. The co-occurrence of polyaromatic hydrocarbons derived from fire (e.g. retene) indicates that heat related generation of short chain n-alkanes indeed may have played an additional part in the formation of the observed soil n-alkane patterns. These two potential origins were further investigated by compound specific carbon and hydrogen isotope analyses of the plant and soil n-alkane assemblages. These data show that the $\delta$13C and $\delta$D signatures of the short chain n-alkanes in the soil resemble those of the plants. Our study therefore provides strong evidence that EOP among short chain n-alkanes can represent a primary (i.e. non-diagenetic) signature, which originates directly from biological sources. In the case of this Queensland soil, the leaves and roots of higher plants are likely to be the principal sources, together with a smaller secondary contribution from the combustion of associated long chain n-alkanes during bushfires.},

abstract = {Wood is the main renewable material on Earth and is largely used as building material and in paper-pulp manufacturing. This review describes the composition of lignocellulosic materials, the different processes by which fungi are able to alter wood, including decay patterns caused by white, brown, and soft-rot fungi, and fungal staining of wood. The chemical, enzymatic, and molecular aspects of the fungal attack of lignin, which represents the key step in wood decay, are also discussed. Modern analytical techniques to investigate fungal degradation and modification of the lignin polymer are reviewed, as are the different oxidative enzymes (oxidoreductases) involved in lignin degradation. These include laccases, high redox potential ligninolytic peroxidases (lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and versatile peroxidase), and oxidases. Special emphasis is given to the reactions catalyzed, their synergistic action on lignin, and the structural bases for their unique catalytic properties. Broadening our knowledge of lignocellulose biodegradation processes should contribute to better control of wood-decaying fungi, as well as to the development of new biocatalysts of industrial interest based on these organisms and their enzymes.},

abstract = {The Progressive Nitrogen Limitation (PNL) hypothesis suggests that ecosystems in a CO2-enriched atmosphere will sequester C and N in long-lived biomass and soil organic pools, thereby limiting available N and constraining the continued response of net primary productivity to elevated [CO2]. Here, we present a six-year record of N dynamics of a sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) stand exposed to elevated [CO2] in the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. We also evaluate the concept of PNL for this ecosystem from the perspective of N uptake, content, distribution, and turnover, and N-use efficiency. Leaf N content was 11\% lower on a leaf mass basis (NM) and 7\% lower on a leaf area basis (NA) in CO2-enriched trees. However, there was no effect of [CO2] on total canopy N content. Resorption of N during senescence was not altered by [CO2], so NM of litter, but not total N content, was reduced. The NM of fine roots was not affected, but the total amount of N required for fine-root production increased significantly, reflecting the large stimulation of fine-root production in this stand. Hence, total N requirement of the trees was higher in elevated [CO2], and the increased requirement was met through an increase in N uptake rather than increased retranslocation of stored reserves. Increased N uptake was correlated with increased net primary productivity (NPP). N-use efficiency, however, did not change with CO2 enrichment because increased N productivity was offset by lower mean residence time of N in the trees. None of the measured responses of plant N dynamics in this ecosystem indicated the occurrence of PNL, and the stimulation of NPP by elevated [CO2] was sustained for the first six years of the experiment. Although there are some indications of developing changes in the N economy, the N supply in the soil at this site may be sufficient to meet an increasing demand for available N, especially as the roots of CO2-enriched trees explore deeper in the soil profile.},

abstract = {This study centred on the analysis of lignin in situ of cloned eucalypt and pine kraft pulps. Trametes versicolor laccase-viol uric acid system (LMS) delignifications were performed on a softwood (Pinus pinaster) and a hardwood (Eucalyptus globulus) conventional kraft pulp with an initial kappa number of 34.5 and 15.5, respectively. The LMS treated pulps were then subjected to alkaline extraction stages (E). The kappa number data show that LMS is effective at biodelignifying both softwood and hardwood kraft pulps. However, under the conditions employed in this study, a greater level of biodelignification was obtained with LMS E. globulus (hardwood) than with LMS P. pinaster (softwood), but the amount of lignin removed was higher for the softwood pulp. The original milled wood samples, kraft pulps, biodelignified kraft pulps, and isolated residual lignin and milled wood lignins from the two wood samples have been characterized by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The analysis of the pyrograms indicates that the lignin compositions of the two wood species and corresponding pulps are very different, as expected; however, the knowledge of the chemical mechanisms of delignification is very limited and requires additional work. Analytical pyrolysis is one the few degradative methods for the analysis of biopolymers that has shown a sufficient degree of success. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Van Soest fractionation is widely employed to characterize exogenous organic matter. The soluble fraction of Van Soest fractionation (SOL, extracted using hot water and then neutral detergent) often increases in line with compost maturity, although it is generally considered as labile. We have developed an alternative extraction method that comprises four successive steps (extraction using hot water, sodium tetraborate, dichloromethane/methanol and chelating resin) in order to clarify the chemical nature of the SOL fraction and explain its biodegradability. This method was tested on municipal solid waste compost sampled during the thermophilic phase (MSWi) and after 8 months of composting (MSWm). Both methods extracted similar proportions of organic matter. The composition of the residues was similar in MSWm although differences were noted for the extraction of polysaccharides and lipids in the case of MSWi. The hot water extractable fraction decreased during composting. Its high biodegradability in MSWi was linked to the high polysaccharide content revealed by pyrolysis-GC/MS and FTIR spectroscopy. The increase in the sodium tetraborate extractable fraction mainly explained the increase in the SOL fraction during composting. This was made up of N-containing compounds, polysaccharides and lipids in the immature compost, and a majority of N-containing compounds in the mature compost. During composting, the stabilization of organic matter in the SOL fraction extractable by sodium tetraborate and EDTA might principally involve N-containing structures through the formation of complexes of organic matter with metal ions, especially Ca(2+), which may be broken down during extraction of the Van Soest soluble fraction. These mechanisms still need to be investigated.},

This study was undertaken to assess the selective chemical transformations that saprophagous soil invertebrates mediate in consumed leaf litter. A number of pill millipedes (Glomeris marginata) were fed oak leaves (Quercus robur) after which the biomolecular compositions (lipids and macromolecular components) of the leaves and millipede faeces were compared using a series of wet chemical techniques and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). It was found that the concentrations of short chain (\&lt; C-20) n-alkanoic acids, sterols and triaclglycerols reduced dramatically in the millipede faeces relative to the leaf litter. Hydrolysable carbohydrates and proteins both decreased in concentration in the faeces, whereas similar yields of phenolic components were observed for the cupric oxidation products of lignin, although the oxygenated functionalities were affected by passage through the millipede gut, yielding a more highly condensed state for lignin. This shows that the chemical composition of fresh organic matter entering the soil is directly controlled by invertebrates feeding upon the leaf litter and as such that they are key contributors to the early stages of diagenesis in terrestrial soils.

abstract = {Lignin, a resistant cell-wall constituent of all vascular plants that consists of ether and carbon-linked methoxyphenols, is still far from being structurally described in detail. The main problem in its structural elucidation is the difficulty of isolating lignin from other wood components without damaging lignin itself. Furthermore, the high number and variegated forms of linkages that occur between the monomeric units and the chemical resistance of certain ether bonds limit the extent to which analytical and degradation procedures can be used to elucidate the lignin structure. Most of our present knowledge about the molecular structure of lignin is based on the analysis of monomers, dimers or, at the most, tetramers of degraded isolated lignins. Mass spectrometry (MS), which offers advantages in terms of speed, specificity, and sensitivity, has revealed to be a very powerful technique in the structural elucidation of lignins, in combination with the great number of chemical and thermal degradation methods available in the study of lignin. Moreover, the recent development of new ionization techniques in MS-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS-has provided new possibilities to also analyze the undegraded lignin macromolecule.},

abstract = {Forages and by-products, such as stovers and hulls, are important ruminant feedstuffs. Considerable effort is expended on composition determination, including research to better understand the relationship between composition and utilization by ruminants. Most of the procedures used are empirical in nature and make such determinations difficult at best. For example, the primary procedures used to determine a forage's potential feeding value are based on fiber determinations using extractive procedures. While it is possible to chemically analyze feedstuffs in a non-empirical fashion, the analyses required are so time consuming and extensive as to be generally impractical. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PY-GC/MS), on the other hand, is simple to carry out and generates no waste, while being capable of simultaneously providing information on the composition of many or all of the feedstuff constituents. Research has demonstrated that PY-GC/MS can provide detailed information on constituents such as lignin, tannins, carbohydrates, etc. The information provided has been shown to be useful in determining the basis for wet chemical procedures (i.e. what exactly does a procedure determine), in differentiating subtle differences in composition between varieties of the same plant species, and in comparing the overall composition of one material to another. Finally, PY-GC/MS can be a tremendous tool for the determination of forage and by-product composition which has until now been largely ignored by animal nutritionists and forage researchers.

@article{Talbot2011,
abstract = {Litter decay rates are often correlated with the initial lignin:N or lignin:cellulose content of litter, suggesting that interactions between lignin and more labile compounds are important controls over litter decomposition. The chemical composition of lignin may influence these interactions, if lignin physically or chemically protects labile components from microbial attack. We tested the effect of lignin chemical composition on litter decay in the field during a year-long litterbag study using the model system Arabidopsis thaliana. Three Arabidopsis plant types were used, including one with high amounts of guaiacyl-type lignin, one with high aldehyde- and p-hydroxyphenyl-type lignin, and a wild type control with high syringyl-type lignin. The high aldehyde litter lost significantly more mass than the other plant types, due to greater losses of cellulose, hemicellulose, and N. Aldehyde-rich lignins and p-hydroxyphenyl-type lignins have low levels of cross-linking between lignins and polysaccharides, supporting the hypothesis that chemical protection of labile polysaccharides and N is a mechanism by which lignin controls total litter decay rates. 2D NMR of litters showed that lignin losses were associated with the ratio of guaiacyl-to-p-hydroxyphenyl units in lignin, because these units polymerize to form different amounts of labile- and recalcitrant-linkages within the lignin polymer. Different controls over lignin decay and polysaccharide and N decay may explain why lignin:N and lignin:cellulose ratios can be better predictors of decay rates than lignin content alone.},

abstract = {Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants exhibit a complex interplay between CO2 fixation by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco), and carbon demand for CAM maintenance and growth. This study investigated the flux of carbon from PEPC and direct Rubisco fixation to different leaf carbon pools and to phloem sap over the diurnal cycle. Concentrations and carbon isotope compositions of starch, soluble sugars, and organic acids were determined in leaves and phloem exudates of Kalancho daigremontiana Hamet et Perr., and related to CO2 fixation by PEPC and Rubisco. Three types of leaf carbon pools could be distinguished. (i) Starch and malate pools were dominant and showed a pattern of reciprocal mobilization and accumulation (85/54 and 13/48 mg C g1 DW, respective, at the beginning/end of phase I). The carbon isotope composition of these pools was compatible with predominant PEPC fixation ( 13C values of 13 and 11 for starch and malate compared to 11 of PEPC fixed carbon). (ii) Isotopic composition (17 and 14) and concentration of glucose and fructose (2 and 3 mg C g1 DW, respectively) were not affected by diurnal metabolism, suggesting a low turnover. (iii) Sucrose (13 mg C g1 DW), in contrast, exhibited large diurnal changes in 13C values (from 17 in the evening to 12 in the morning), which were not matched by net changes in sucrose concentration. This suggests a high sucrose turnover, fed by nocturnal starch degradation and direct Rubisco fixation during the day. A detailed dissection of the carbon fixation and mobilization pattern in K. daigremontiana revealed that direct fixation of Rubisco during the light accounted for 30\% of phloem sucrose, but only 15\% of fixed carbon, indicating that carbon from direct Rubisco fixation was preferentially used for leaf export.},

abstract = {Two series of black-coloured macromolecular products were prepared by: (a) acid-catalyzed dehydration of a glucose solution and (b) heating crystalline cellulose. These substances were analyzed by standard chemical and spectroscopic techniques, which revealed a more or less marked carbohydrate signature. The analytical pyrolysis showed striking differences between the two series of substances. The carbohydrate origin of the charred celluloses (even after 48 wt.\% loss) was evident from the major peaks of anhydrosugars, while the alkylbenzenes and alkylphenols were found in comparatively low amounts. In contrast, the glucose browning substances showed pyrolysis patterns where aromatic molecules coexist with lower amounts of furan compounds. The results are interpreted in terms of the possible diagenetic pathways of sedimentary carbohydrate, and of the potential of pyrolysis to reveal the carbohydrate origin of geomacromolecules.

abstract = {The dynamics of soil organic carbon are included in global carbon (C) cycle scenarios using different, but generally arbitrary defined, kinetic pools. To improve global C models, better relationships between the chemical structure of soil organic matter (SOM) and its kinetic pools are needed. To assess the molecular residence time of SOM and the relation with plant inputs, pyrolysis-GC/MS-C-IRMS was performed on maize plants and on two samples from the same soil that had undergone a vegetation change from the C3 plant wheat to the C4 plant maize. This vegetation change has added naturally C-13-enriched material to the soil. Most pyrolysis products from the maize were derived from polysaccharides and lignins, and were not detected in soils. However, polysaccharide-derived products were also major pyrolysis products in soils, N-containing or unspecific pyrolysis products were also detected. The residence times (based on C-13 natural labelling) revealed a continuum of values, that was independent of chemical structure, with only two pyrolysis products presenting a relatively long residence time (ca. 100 years). An unexpected long life-time for N-containing (similar to49 years) and polysaccharide-derived (similar to54 years) pyrolysis products was found. Our results suggest that mainly recycling of carbon in carbohydrates and N-containing materials in addition to physical and chemical protection is responsible for SOM stabilization in the slow carbon pool.

abstract = {Cell wall digestibility is an important determinant of forage quality, but the relationship between cell wall composition and digestibility is poorly understood. We analyzed the neutral detergent fiber (NDF) fraction of nine maize inbred lines and one brown midrib3 mutant with pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). Among 29 pyrolysis fragments that were quantified, two carbohydrate-derived and six lignin-derived fragments showed statistically significant genetic variation. The pyrolysis products 4-vinyl phenol and 2,6-dimethoxy-4-vinyl phenol were negatively correlated with digestibility, whereas furfural and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-oxopropanal showed a positive correlation with digestibility. Linear discriminant analysis of the pyrolysis data resulted in the resolution of groups of inbred lines with different digestibility properties based on their chemical composition. These analyses reveal that digestibility is governed by complex interactions between different cell wall compounds, but that several pyrolysis fragments can be used as markers to distinguish between maize lines with different digestibility.},

abstract = {Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), was used in the molecular characterisation of lignin in wheat straw during its fungal degradation by Agaricus bisporus. The decayed wheat straw had a lower proportion of syringyl to guaiacyl derived moieties than its native counterpart. The ratio of methyl 3,4-dimethoxybenzoate to 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde increased from 1.0 in native wheat straw to 6.4 following fungal degradation. Similarly the ratio of methyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate to 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde increased from 1.6 in native wheat straw to 3.1 upon decay. The increase in both guaiacyl and syringyl acid to aldehyde ratios indicated that A. bisporus induces oxidative cleavage of lignin at the C alpha -C beta bonds. Both the threo - and erythro - isomers of 1-(3,4-dimethoxypfienyl)-1,2,3-trimethoxypropane decreased in intensity relative to other thermochemolysis products in degraded wheat straw. The increase in the ratio of methyl 3,4,-dimethoxybenzoate to the sum of 1-(3,4dimethoxyphenyl)-1,2,3-trimethoxypropane (threo- and erythro- isomers) from 1.0 in native wheat straw to 10.9 in A. bisporus decayed wheat straw confirmed that the fungus had cleaved alkyl side chains. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the presence of TMAH provides a sensitive method for tracking the oxidative degradation of lignin during the fungal decay of wheat straw.
